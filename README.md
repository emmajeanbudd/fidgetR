# Project Title - FidgetR
Welcome to our app! We’re so glad you made it this far! Using FidgetR is extremely simple and intuitive. Do you like spinning things? How about playing sounds? Hopefully you said yes because that’s all you need to use FidgetR. As you use each of the 3 fidget pieces of FidgetR, you can have a more peaceful and relaxed day. 


# Getting Started
To begin, open the application from your Android device. Since you’ll be using your phone’s speaker, we suggest you either use headphones or are in a quiet room. Once you arrive on FidgetR’s home page, you have 3 choices; The spinner image, the kaleidoscope image, or the music note image. 

From the three image buttons, you can:

**You chose spin!** If you gently (or forcefully, we’re not responsible for broken phones :) ) spin your phone, the image on the screen will change. That’s all there is to it. Now have fun fidgeting!

**You chose music!** By pressing each of the six images, different sounds will play. When a sound is turned on, the image will turn a different  color. If you click the image again, the sound will turn off. Play around with what sounds are appealing together. Now have fun fidgeting!

**You chose kaleidoscope!**
